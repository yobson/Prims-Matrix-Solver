# Prims-Matrix-Solver
A QT graphical application for finding a minimum spanning tree

###INSTALL
You can open this in QT Creator, it will ask you what kit you want to use. It has worked with all kits I have tested thus far

###How To Use
Open the app

Input the number of nodes in your network

Press the set Nodes button

A table shall magically appear!

Input your network as a matrix, it will auto compleate the other half of the matrix for you.

If two nodes are not connected, input a dash.



Press find MST


it will give you the mst in the form a->b where a and b are connected nodes


###notes
any data over 1 billion will make it not work
mainwondow.cpp is commented if you want to know how it works
